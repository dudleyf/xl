Xl
==

This is a library for reading and writing Excel OOXML files, based on [openpyxl](http://bitbucket.org/ericgazoni/openpyxl/). It's a pretty direct port, so much of it is still pythonic. I expect the interface (and implementation) will change drastically before it's all said and done.
It's brand new, so it's likely buggy, possibly unusable, and certainly incomplete. Also it has a stupid name.

Usage
-----
  require 'xl'

  wb = Xl::Workbook.new
  ws = wb.create_sheet
  ws.cell('A1').value = 'Hello, World!'
  Xl::Xml.save_workbook(wb, 'hello.xlsx')
